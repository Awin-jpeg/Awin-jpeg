New here.

This is currently a side project in response to the data security concerns regarding recent
Windows 11 changes. Removal of workarounds for operating Windows without active Microsoft
accounts and Recall has shifted my attention to Linux.

With some prior knowledge, I have opted to try Arch for its bare-bones nature.

Current Project: 

To boot into window manager after startup. I would like some kind of GUI login page where I
may select account to log in with.

- Removal of gnome
- Custom or open source login landing screen
- load to landing page after boot (skip the BIOS screen, it is annoying to click through)
